# websocket-chat

A WebSocket chat server. Experiment by Nicholas Costa.

Ayy what is security I put stuff in da window with innerHTML

So anyway to actually run the thing download it and run in your terminal
  node test.js
And then open index.html
By thw way if you want to chat with your friends find the part in client.js that says
  "ws://127.0.0.1:42069"
And have them change the ip there to the ip of the computer test.js is running on.
Then just type stuff in one box and it comes out into their computer hopefully
